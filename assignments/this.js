*
* 1. Window binding: If the .this keyword is not pointed in any particular direction, it defaults to the window object, unless we are in strict mode, when it will default to undefined.
* 2. Implicit binding: In implicit binding, the .this keyword refers to whatever is placed before the dot.  This only applies to objects with methods.
* 3. New binding:
* 4. Explicit binding:
